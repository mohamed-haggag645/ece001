<h2>Computer Program<h2>
<ul>
<li> A program is a set of instructions following the rules
       of the chosen language. </li>
<li> Without programs, computers are useless. </li>
<li> A program is like a recipe. </li>
<li> It contains a list of ingredients (called variables) and
     a list of directions (called statements) that tell the
     computer what to do with the variables.  </li>
		
		<h2>Programming Language</h2>
		
<h3><ul>
   <li>  A vocabulary and set of grammatical rules (syntax)for instructing a computer to perform specific tasks.</li>
   <li>  Programming languages can be used to createcomputer programs.</li>
   <li>  The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++,COBOL, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal.</li>
   <li>You eventually need to convert your program into
machine language so that the computer can
understand it.</li>
   <li>There are two ways to do this:
– Compile the program
– Interpret the program</li>
   <li>Compile is to transform a program written in a highlevel programming language from source code into
object code.</li>
<li>This can be done by using a tool called compiler.</li>
<li>A compiler reads the whole source code and
translates it into a complete machine code program
to perform the required tasks which is output as a
new file.</li>
<li>Interpreter is a program that executes instructions
written in a high-level language.</li>
<li>An interpreter reads the source code one instruction
or line at a time, converts this line into machine code
and executes it.</li>
</ul> </h3>
